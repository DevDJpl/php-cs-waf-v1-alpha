# CyberSecurity WAF Gate v1.0-alpha
PHP CyberSecutiy WAF Gate Alpha Version 1.0
The first version of WAF I made a few years ago with little skills at that time, with only a few functions checking the client's connection to the website. I decided to share it due to the fact that I wrote my current WAF from scratch due to the code and its quality. I hope it will be good for someone. Regards :)
